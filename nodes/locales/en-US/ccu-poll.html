    <p>Triggers an immediate polling of Sysvars from ReGaHSS.</p>
    <p>This node is intended to receive changes of variables with lower latency. You can create a CCU Program that
        reacts to variable changes by pressing a virtual button, this virtual button presses can then be received by a
        <i>value</i> or <i>rpc event</i> node that triggers an update of the variables through the <i>ccu poll</i>
        node.
